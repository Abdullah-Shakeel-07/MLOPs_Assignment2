Here are the steps: 
Create a Flask app 
Confirm the flask app can run
->Add a Dockerfile to the src dir 
->Run command from terminal: docker image build -t docker-flask-test . (donâ€™t miss the last . docker-flask-test is the name of file) 
->Run command: docker run -p 5000:5000 -d docker-flask-test
Note: we are binding the host port 5000 to the container port 5000. We are also running in detached mode so the terminal shows up in separate window and naming the container. 
You will see the container ID appear, you can see the logs by typing in: docker container logs [Image ID]
->docker container stop [ID] will stop the container 
docker system prune will remove any stopped containers, unused volumes and networks, and dangling images.
